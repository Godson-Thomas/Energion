## ***_Description_***

_Most of the power-saving modules available in Indian markets only show the individual appliance power consumptions but do not conserve power or give any custom recommendations on power savings.The present energy meters require human intervention and manual operation of the appliances to save power, that too without any recommendations. The present meters can also be highly prone to errors.To address this problem, we have come up with our idea called ***Energion***, which is an intelligent power-saving device that automatically monitors, controls, and adjusts the energy consumption of the users' appliances._
